As we are aware information or data is increasing at an amazing rate. In fact some industry expects that collected information sizes will probably double in size every two to three years. Basically data which is no longer needed by the application to address business functionality should be purged or archived. If data is required for record retention requirements, then it should be archived from the DBMS to an application controlled format. Keeping unneeded data online or in warehouses have costs associated with them which can directly affect our membership. Transactions can take longer to process, and use more CPU which also increases the cost of each transaction. DBMS utilities like backups can run longer, takes more storage and use more CPU (Increase product cost)\nResponsibilities\t\t\nAnalysis of Business Requirements.\nCoordination with on-site team to understand the requirements \nInvolved in the DB design & Architecture (application) Design\t\nAnalysis of the current customer system to plug-in new requirements\nInvolved in all project activities such as analysis & design, coding, integration and testing.\nConfiguration and Defect management using Star Team\nEnvironment: Intel 0x86 Architecture, UNIX, Linux and Windows XP/VISTA, IBM Java Technology Version 1.4, MySql,DB2, DB2,MySql\nUnited Services mobile Association\t\t\t \t\tMar 2007 to April 2008\nJava Developer\nTitle: USAA-Bank CLO E-Fulfilment-OF\nProject:  USAA is a fully integrated financial services company in United States of America serving more than 6 million military members.
