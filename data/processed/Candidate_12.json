Medintelli Electronic Health Record (EHR) solution makes it easy transition from paper to electronic health records. We provide a complete Electronic Medical Records (EMR) solution that is easy to use with fully integrated Medical Practice Management and patient portal solution. Through the patient portal, patients can securely access their medical records, view test results, pay bills, and schedule appointments from anywhere, at any time via the Internet and create a HIPAA-compliant paperless environment.\nPatient Health Records (PHR): Manages patients in this module. The patients have full access to their records from this portal. They can schedule/cancel an appointment, view lab records, alerts, medication, prescriptions from this module.\nFront desk portal: The front desk portal manages different modules. In this module, they can schedule an appointment; check the validation of insurance billing.\nDoctor portal: The portal is integrated with different modules. The doctor can have the electronic medical records with HIPPA compliance. Doctor can get alert on history, allergies and complication of a patient. From this portal, a secure direct access is provided to transcription portal.\nGrouping and Matching: With this you can maintain groups. This in turn eases the ability to match the regulations setup by HIPPA. You can create searchable groups and categorize applicants based on your requirements.\nSmart Communication: Since communication is a key aspect of healthcare process, this system gives you the flexibility of communicating via email, phone, and fax. This piece is tightly integrated with the software and can be invoked and used from very minor use to critical pieces. You can set reminders, send group messages, can send smart responses etc. We have tight integration with PDAs and Smart phones/ devices and give you the flexibility to manage communication with these devices anytime/anywhere. \nCompliance & Reporting: You have lots of built in report types that can tell you everything you want to know about your patients, Customers and job order. You also can generate custom reports for any specific purposes. Compliance reports dramatically reduce time spent gathering regulatory information for government and other reporting requirements. \nOther System Integration: Integration to other systems is very important to any new software system. With this we can integrate our system to variety of systems like Lab integrations, Electronic prescriptions\nResponsibilities\nInvolved in SDLC Requirements gathering, Analysis, Design, Development and Testing of application using Agile Model.\n  Actively Involved in designing the outline of project, understanding of business necessities and interacted with other team members to understand the requirements for the project.\nBuild Microservices For Delivery of software product across the Enterprise.\nImplemented J2EE standards, MVC architecture using Spring(MVC)Framework and combined with ORM(Hibernate) framework.\nDeveloped application modules using Spring MVC, Spring Annotations, Spring Beans, Dependency Injection, with database interface using Hibernate. \nInvolved in the design and development of Batch Jobs using Spring Batch Architecture.
