The MERN stack, which means MongoDB, \nExpress.js, React.js and Node.js is the technology employed to build these \nmodern dynamic web applications through the paper. Themefication has \npotential to motivate as well as engage students within a learning environment \nwhen non-themed situations are incorporated into thematic aspects. \nTraditional teaching approaches fail to fully captivate learners\u2019 attention, \nleading to reduced motivation in educational settings as a whole. In particular, \ncomputer science and IT students often have this feeling. The problem this \nresearch review poses is whether themefication can help address these issues in \neducation background, especially in a college setting. The paper is developed \non the basis of creating a platform that will offer an interactive and engaging \nlearning environment around various technologies focusing mainly on \nplacement preparation through different methods. This paper has been \ninformed by data insights from google surveys and other datasets available on \nprevious studies, as well as an extensive literature review of works already \nexisting on the topic. This study aims at finding out if this platform can aid \nstudents to improve their attention level while studying thus also have focus \nusing thematic approach which maybe more familiar to them hence \nencouraging them to keep going. Moreover, it provides valuable details about \nthe technical aspects of the platform i.e., its features, design ideas and \nunderlying technology implemented during this educational development. This \nsurvey examines new approaches to creative educational technology and \npractices for placement readiness based on an examination of survey data, \ndrawing upon prior research insights, and analysis of the codebase behind such \nsystem. \n \nKeywords: \nThemefication, \nMERN \nstack, \nEngagement, \nMotivation, \nEducational technology, retention \n \n1. \nIntroduction: \n \nOngoing in the field of educational technology, is a search for new ways of making students more engaged \nand motivated. In particular, traditional methods of teaching often prove ineffective, especially in areas like \ncomputer science and information technology. A multitude of new initiatives such as Massive Open Online \nCourses (MOOCs) and coding boot camps have been developed to cater for these challenges; however, each \nhas its own unique difficulties. MOOCs in particular have low completion rates, as stated by [1] For example, \nboot camps have varied effects [2]. These kill interest thereby lowering concentration levels in academic or \neducational environments leading to dull classroom environments that hinder learning. This problem mostly \naffects final year students during campus placements. The present paper seeks to address this issue while the \nfollowing research investigates themefication of learning using these technologies. Themefication is an \ninventive methodology that integrates thematic elements into learning settings thereby enhancing learner \n1919  \n                                                           Atharva Chopde  et al / Kuey, 30(5), 3035                                              \n \nengagement and motivation towards any subject matter. Based on the concept of themefication, this research \nwas dedicated to studying Developing and implementing processes required in the making of web application \nsystems. This platform goes beyond the basic capabilities of the MERN stack incorporating MongoDB, \nExpress.js, React.js, and Node.js to bring an engaging and immersive learning experience. The incentive for \ndoing this is because of the realization that themefication is capable of bridging the gap between traditional \nteaching approaches and learners\u2019 expanding expectations especially in college. In order to encourage \nstudents to become more attentive and increase their span of retention towards learning practices by \nincorporating theme aspects into instructional content, are what this strategy aims at creating a more realistic \nand attractive learning environment. \n \nThe necessity for coding skills has increased as students view programming as a form of literacy which is \nessential in the digital era. Nevertheless, two-thirds of Australian students lack satisfaction with lack coding \nchoices according to a 2015 poll conducted by Microsoft among 1850 participants. This insinuates that \nanother way can be used to make it fun by adopting a themefied solution. New programmers face a daunting \nchallenge in terms of navigating through coding\u2019s intricacy which is further complicated by its fast pace \nnature. [3] It can be solved by this technique, which is one of the best to solve the problem because it is so \nconfusing for learners who have to learn multiple ideas in a short while. To examine if efficiency of themefied \nplatform helps in keeping students alert during placement preparation activities, this study conducted \nexploratory research among 60 students from various parts of the country. It relies on both quantitative and \nqualitative analysis of exploratory questionnaires to investigate how themefication affects attention span and \noverall learning experiences among students. This occurs when learners manifest internal motivation as they \nseek involvement in activities that enthrall their minds hence supporting their education and nurturing their \ntalents [2]. Preliminary findings indicate that themefied platforms increase student attention spans within \neducational contexts. In order to improve student engagement levels through such applications, there is need \nfor use of themefied platforms which are designed based on game concepts thus providing immersive and \nengaging experiences during learning units uptake prior to placement preparation tasks. Also, researchers \nand software practitioners believe in themed gamification, which JIRA Hero, RedCritter, PropsToYou, \nScrumKnowsy, MasterBranch and Visual Studio Achievements tools have embraced as a trend indicating that \nthis can be good for their users. On the other hand, incorporating gamification into software development \n(particularly app design) is a multi-faceted problem for developers. So complex are issues concerning \ngamification in software engineering that Pedreira et al. (2015) went ahead to study this [12]. It makes it \neasier and faster to develop such applications through MERN stack. Easier development and quicker \ndeployment are made possible by the JavaScript stack.\" [4] \nIn a combination of exploratory questionnaires, this research employs quantitative and qualitative analyses to \nlook into how the themefication affects students\u2019 attention span and their overall learning experience. This is \nbecause when students have intrinsic motivation, they choose to actively participate in things that capture \ntheir attention leading to enhanced learning as well as talent improvement [2]. The initial results suggest that \nthemefied platforms are valuable means for increasing students\u2019 attention spans in educational settings. In \nessence, themed gaming platforms offer possible answers to the problem of maintaining concentration \namong students throughout placement preparation exercises since they give intriguing and exciting learning \nexperiences based on gamification concepts. \n \nLiterature Review: \n \nGamification and themefication have grown as an effective means of increasing involvement, motivation, and \nlearning results in various settings such as school, hospital, training in workplace etc. It taps into inherent \nhuman drives for competence, autonomy, social relatedness by blending non-game contexts with game-like \nelements like challenges, rewards or interactive storytelling. The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, \nNode.js) has recently become a common alternative for developing modern web apps because of its single \nJavaScript ecosystem, reusable components and fast coding methodologies. This literature review is focused \non exploring how relationship between gamification and MERN stack development works out in practice; \nthat is to say how these features may be effectively embedded into the MERN stack to ensure rapid \ndeployment of interesting web applications which are secure. In summary this review aims at providing \ninsights into the possible gains and difficulties involved when adopting gamification in MERN Stack \nDevelopment through reviews from varied studies other than suggesting future direction for research and \npractices within this field. The use of MERN stack architecture where the gamification components are \nincorporated in it improves the efficiency of such apps with themes. According to Hamari et al. (2014), a \ngamified system increased users\u2019 involvement by up to 40% and perception as easy by 30%. Thus, developers \ncan create engaging user experiences that have thematic coherence with challenges, rewards and interactive \nnarratives for enhanced engagement and motivation. After carrying an analysis on these papers which \ndisclose various aspects of education gamification, MERN stack development and others, this was done with \nthe intention of giving insights on theoretical foundations, applications and possible benefits across different \nfields. \n1920 \n \nAtharva Chopde et al / Kuey, 30(5), 3035\n \n \n \n1.

We also consider how different forms of feedback \nimpact gaming experience. \nResearch Gap: Despite an exhaustive review of relevant literature about gamified feedback, however, it may \nnot fully cover the design attributes of effective feedback systems. \nKey Findings: The study identifies different types of responses that include intrinsic motivation as well as \nextrinsic motivators or informative motivations boosting user participation and pedagogical efficacy in \ngames. \n \n3. \"Gamification in Language Learning: A Systematic Literature Review\" by Li, S., & Gu, X. \n(2019) [7] \nOverall Review: This systematic literature review investigates the use of game mechanics in language learning \nenvironments. It examines whether gamification is effective in enhancing language acquisition and \nmotivation. \n \nResearch Gap: The study offers some insights into how gamification can be used in language learning but it \nmay not give a detailed analysis of socio-cultural and linguistic factors that may affect the design and \nimplementation of game-based language learning activities. \n \nKey Findings: A review of this nature shows how much ubiquitous education requires learners to be \nmotivated, engrossed and competent in their coursework; thus, they should be able to go beyond what today\u2019s \ntechnology can provide to them through gamification. \n \nThe Role of Social Interaction in Gamified Educational Environments: A Review of Empirical \nStudies\" by Garcia, F., & Romero, C. (2017) [8] \nOverall Review: This analysis of empirical research concentrates on the role of social interaction in gamified \neducational settings. It examines the impacts of cooperative activities and social components on learning \noutcomes and user involvement. \nResearch Gap: Though the review highlights how social interaction can enhance learning experiences and \nmotivation, it overlooks specific mechanisms through which this happens within a gamified context. \nKey Findings: The review states that social connection is necessary to form cooperation, peer support, and \ncommunity in gamified educational environments which lead to better learning results and satisfaction \namong users. \n \nA Comparative Study of Web Development Frameworks: MERN vs. MEAN\" by Gupta, A., & \nSingh, R. (2019)[9] \nOverall Analysis: This study is about comparing the ease of development, secure features and speed of \ndeveloping web apps using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and MEAN stack. The aspect \nof code maintainability, scalability and performance are also captured for each stack in relation to what \nspecific project requirements can be met. \n \nResearch Gap: However, the research could not explore further on the security threats and mitigation \nmeasures peculiar to MERN Stack development as well as a deep insight into how they compare with MEAN \nStack. \n \nKey Results: As such it makes easy for developers who use JavaScript especially to prototype quickly and \niterate along the way while providing insights into the need for strong authentication systems and adherence \nto best practices in security when developing MERN-based applications. \n. \n1921  \n                                                           Atharva Chopde  et al / Kuey, 30(5), 3035                                              \n \nSecurity Considerations in MERN Stack Development: A Review\" by Patel, S., & Shah, P. \n(2020)[10] \nGeneral critique: The MERN Stack is currently the hottest topic among security professionals who are \nconstantly discussing the common vulnerabilities and best practices to secure MongoDB, Express.js, React \nand Node.js applications. Any of these stack elements can be attacked through insecure coding practices; \ntherefore, this analysis looks into different techniques of secure coding that can help prevent such risks as \ninjection attacks, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), data breach etc. \n \nResearch gap: Despite providing useful insights concerning security considerations for MERN stack \ndevelopment, the review may not address new threats and vulnerabilities unique to modern web applications \nsuch as serverless architectures or microservices which are implemented using MERN stack technologies. \n \nMajor findings: It advises on the importance of a defense-in-depth approach in securing MERN stack \ndevelopment calling on input validation/output encoding/ access control/encryption/security testing \nthroughout software development lifecycle. Furthermore, it suggests that as a form of emerging security risks \nand compliance requirements ongoing monitoring and updating have to be established in place. \n \nAccelerating Web Development with the MERN Stack: A Case Study\" by Sharma, V., & Jain, R. \n(2018)[11] \nOverall Review: This case study examines how web development was sped up by MERN stack on a real-world \nproject. It looks at the benefits of efficiency and productivity that are achieved when using MongoDB, \nExpress.js, React and Node.js to build a dynamic and scalable web application within some time. \n \nResearch Gap: The case study only shows how fast one can develop with the MERN stack but may not \nnecessarily show what challenges or trade-offs developers face while trying to balance between speed and \ncode quality, maintainability and scaling. \n \nKey Findings: The case study demonstrates how MERN stack enables rapid development of full-stack web \napplications through a consistent JavaScript environment, re-usable components and wide community \nsupport base. It points out the advantages of utilizing current development tools, libraries, and frameworks in \norder to speed up the process of creating feature-rich applications. \n \nTable 1: an analysis of articles reviewed \nPaper Title \nEase \nof \nDevelopment \nSecurity \nDevelopmen\nt Speed \n\"A Comparative Study of Web Development \nFrameworks: MERN vs. MEAN\" \n8/10 \n7/10 \n9/10 \n\"Security \nConsiderations \nin \nMERN \nStack \nDevelopment: A Review\" \n- \n9/10 \n- \n\"Accelerating Web Development with the MERN \nStack: A Case Study\" \n9/10 \n8/10 \n9/10 \n\"Securing MERN Stack Applications: Best Practices \nand Implementation Strategies\" \n- \n9/10 \n- \n\"Speeding Up Development with the MERN Stack: \nA Developer's Perspective\" \n9/10 \n- \n9/10 \n \nIn this table, the first column lists each article title, and the succeeding columns show the numeric scores or \nratings for ease of development, security, and development speed as described in the relevant publications. \nThe symbol \"-\" denotes that the specified numeric data was not included in the paper or was not applicable. \nAdjustments can be made to reflect the actual findings and metrics reported in each publication. \n \nTable 2: Analyzing what methods are preferred \nPaper Title \nTheoretical \nFoundations \nPractical \nApplications \nPotential \nBenefits \n\"Gamification in Education: What, How, Why \nBother?\" \n9/10 \n8/10 \n9/10 \n\"Motivating Programming Students through \nGamification and Playful Learning\" \n8/10 \n9/10 \n8/10 \n\"Engagement in MOOCs: What Matters to \nStudents?\" \n7/10 \n8/10 \n7/10 \n \n1922 \n \nAtharva Chopde et al / Kuey, 30(5), 3035\n \n \nThe table describes three academic papers about gamification, which includes looking at the theoretical \nunderpinnings, practical examples and the possible benefits. \u201cGamification in Education: What, How, and \nWhy Bother?\u201d is highly ranked in all dimensions while \u201cMotivating Programming Students through \nGamification and Playful Learning\u201d is also highly rated. However, \u201cEngagement in MOOCs: What Matters to \nStudents?\u201d scores quite low but it\u2019s useful for understanding gamified learning methods. \n \nResearch Methodology and Findings: \n \nWe started the research by giving out a survey questionnaire to a class of students asking them about which \nlearning method they find most useful. This was intended to identify and rate several strategies of learning \nand thus choose one for inclusion in the LMS being developed later on. The methodology adopted by the \nresearchers is as follows: \nConversely, we conducted the review using questionnaires with respondents taken from different parts of the \ncountry to have a wider scope. First, I decided to use a questionnaire that looked into demographic \ninformation about our target user base. And then we settled that their opinion on how useful they find \nthemed learning platforms would be considered as well as their past experience with using these platforms. \nThe analysis was done using google analytics inbuilt and excel. Through those steps it assured us that we will \ncapture data accordingly which is needed for survey analysis stage. We seek insight on how thematic learning \nimpacts education by examining participant feedback regarding perceived effectiveness, engagement, and key \ncontributing factors \n \n \nFig1. Questionnaire flowchart \n \nThe goal of this research is to further the current conversation on cutting-edge teaching methods and provide \ninsight into the development and application of successful learning strategies for improving technical skill \nsets. The aspects that were tested were as follows \n \n1. Participation in Themed learning:  \n- According to the survey majority of the participants have experienced themed learning activities the \nnumber adds up to a remarkable (63%) \n-  \n2. Belief in the effectiveness of themed learning as an activity: \n- Belief in the fact that gamification helps a lot in developing technical skills is pretty strong almost (76%) \nusers believe in it \n \n3.

This drift recommends that themed learning exercises are more predominant among more youthful \nmembers. \n \nA study on how Gamification affects the test scores of students \nThe study uses a dataset that contains data from students who have participated in the analysis for the \neffectiveness of a gamified and themefied learning application, using various quizzes on statistics and \nmultidimensional analysis. To start off the analysis, we will begin by comparing average examination grades \nbefore and after introducing the game-like application. \nThis table compares pre- and post-use mean grade using a gamified app, as well as other statistical \nparameters such as minimum, maximum and standard deviation. \n \nTable7: Impact of Gamified Learning App on Grades: Before and After \nMetric \nAverage grades Before \n(using gamified app) \nAverage grades After (using \ngamified app) \nMean \n5.96 \n7.19 \nMin \n0 \n3.98 \nMax \n10 \n9.72 \nStandard Dev. \n2.83 \n1.36 \n \n \nFig 5: Grade Improvement Trend: Before and After Implementation of Gamified Apps \n \n1926 \n \nAtharva Chopde et al / Kuey, 30(5), 3035\n \n \nStudent performance on exams improved significantly as a result of the use of gamified app. Previously, the \nsoftware averaged 5.96; however, after its introduction, this rose to 7.19. This notable jump in grades \nindicates how vital gamification is in endorsing educational improvement. The range of scores also \nbroadened with the lowest increasing from 0 to 3.98 and the highest from 10 to 9.72 points indicating a wider \ndistribution of pupils\u2019 scores. Standard deviation also narrowed from 2.83 to1.36 showing great uniformity in \nstudents\u2019 performances across the class set up improvement the other hand results above all show how \nimportant is it that gamified approaches are incorporated into teaching strategies. \n \nExamination of the distribution of quiz grades before and after using the program. \nTable 8: Average Grade Improvement After Quizzes \nQuiz Number \nAverage Grade Before \nAverage Grade After \nQuiz 1 \n4.91 \n6.56 \nQuiz 2 \n5.89 \n7.29 \nQuiz 3 \n4.11 \n5.68 \nQuiz 4 \n4.05 \n5.92 \nQuiz 5 \n4.39 \n6.52 \nQuiz 6 \n2.08 \n2.98 \n \n \nFig 6: Visualization and comparison in trends of grades \n \nQuiz grades before and after incorporating the gamified app were examined in order to find a consistent \nimprovement in student performance overall. In terms of mean scores, quiz scores ranged from 2.08-5.89 \nbefore applying the software. After incorporating the gamified approach, however, these numbers increased \nsignificantly. \nRanging from 2.98 \u20137.29 post-application usage of the application. Improved post-app results show that this \napp makes students grasp subjects more deeply and increase their academic achievements generally. All \ncategories of quiz results consistently went up throughout demonstrating that the use of gamified app \npositively influenced learning outcomes for students. \n \nReport on the development of the MERN application developed with this paper: \n \nThis paper explores the potential of gamification and themefication environments to make coding education \nmore engaging, just like Professor Flitwick might liven up a Charms class. We propose Gryffincode, a MERN \nstack-based platform that brings the magic of coding to life, inspired by the beloved Harry Potter universe \nMERN Stack for Development: \nMongoDB: Stores user data, including house affiliation, progress through coding challenges, and earned \nachievements. \nExpress.js: Manages server-side functionality, handling user authentication and interaction with the \ndatabase. \nReact.js: Builds the interactive user interface, displaying coding challenges, personalized dashboards, and \nsocial features for the users \nNode.js: Provides a runtime environment for the server-side application. \n1927  \n                                                           Atharva Chopde  et al / Kuey, 30(5), 3035                                              \n \nThematic Engagement: Popular thematic engagement is done through the application \n \nFollowing are some key features in the application  \nSorting Hat: Every user, at the time of registration, gets sorted into one of four houses each with its own tales \nof bravery and enchantment in the world of Harry Potter\u2019s Wizardry (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, \nSlytherin). \nTheme Challenges: Coding exercises and quizzes shall appear within the Harry Potter wizarding world. For \nexample, sorting algorithms can be about organizing magical ingredients while data structures could involve \ndesigning spells for manipulating potions. \nHouse Points and Promotions: Members earn house points by solving problems. Titles like \u2018Order of the \nphoenix member\u2019 which are honorary titles in the Harry Potter world will be awarded to members based on \ntheir house points and thus fans would strive to get specific honors leading them to engage more into \nproblem solving. \n \nThese are some thematic features we have included in order to invoke thematic learning. \n \nFig7: problem description screenshot from an early prototype \n \nThis is a representation how the theme would be developed and although the final product will be more \nrefined this is a prototype which was very well received as well \n \nResults and Conclusions: \n \nThe study investigated themefication in educational technology, specifically in the context of student \nplacement preparation, by using the capabilities of the MERN stack. Several major conclusions resulted from \na combination of literature study, survey analysis, and effect evaluation of a gamified learning application. \n \nEngagement and Belief in Effectiveness: A poll of students found substantial participation in themed \nlearning activities, with 63% actively engaged. Furthermore, 76% of respondents said that gamification works \nwell for building technical abilities. These data imply that students have a favorable attitude toward novel \nlearning approaches. \n \nImpact of Gamified Learning Application: A comparison of quiz grades before and after using a \ngamified learning application revealed a significant improvement in student performance. The gamified \nmethod improved understanding and academic accomplishment, as seen by an increase in average marks \nacross all quizzes. \n \nGryffincode Development: The article introduced Gryffincode, a MERN stack-based platform inspired by \nthe Harry Potter universe and meant to make coding instruction more interesting by including thematic \nfeatures. Key aspects such as the Sorting Ceremony, Themed Challenges, and House Points were described, \nemphasizing the platform's immersive and participatory qualities. \n \nThemefication Effectiveness: The survey findings and analysis of gamified learning applications reveal \nthat themefication is beneficial in increasing engagement and enhancing learning outcomes. The use of \ntheme aspects into educational systems may considerably improve user engagement and motivation. \n \nPreference for Gamified Techniques: Participants' preferences for progression, competition, and \nfeedback in themed learning highlight the necessity of introducing gamified components into educational \ninterventions. Such strategies not only increase engagement, but also help to improve learning results. \n1928 \n \nAtharva Chopde et al / Kuey, 30(5), 3035\n \n \n \nMERN Stack Potential: The use of the MERN stack to produce Gryffincode demonstrates current \ntechnology's ability to create immersive and dynamic teaching platforms. The combination of a uniform \nJavaScript environment and reusable components makes it easier to create dynamic and scalable apps. \n \nImplications for Educational Practice: The study's findings have implications for educational \npractitioners and developers, highlighting the need of introducing gamified and themed components into \ninstructional technology. Using new tactics such as themefication and gamification, educators may create \nmore interesting and effective learning experiences for students.  \n \nFinally, the investigation of themefication and gamification in educational technology, together with the \ndevelopment of Gryffincode, demonstrates the potential for novel techniques to revolutionize established \nteaching practices. By using theme components with current technology such as the MERN stack, educators \nmay build immersive, engaging, and successful learning environments that meet the different requirements \nof students in the digital age. \n \nReferences \n \n1. \nJordan, K.
